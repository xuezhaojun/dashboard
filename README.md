## Project Overview

A dashboard for displaying and monitoring Open Cluster Management (OCM) clusters, placements, cluster sets, manifest works, and addons.

---

## Architecture

The OCM Dashboard follows a modern architecture pattern for Kubernetes dashboards:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript SPA with Material UI and real-time updates
- **Backend**: Go API service that connects to the Kubernetes API for OCM resources

### Frontend Components

- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication (JWT) stored in localStorage
- **Overview Page**: High-level KPIs for clusters, cluster sets, and placements
- **Cluster List & Detail**: Table view and detail drawer for clusters, including status, version, claims, and addons
- **Placement List & Detail**: Table view and detail drawer for placements, including status, predicates, and decisions
- **ClusterSet List & Detail**: Table view and detail drawer for ManagedClusterSets, including cluster and binding counts
- **ManifestWorks List**: View manifest works for clusters, including manifest and condition details
- **Addons List**: View managed cluster addons, including status, registrations, and supported configs
- **Login Page**: Token-based login with development mode support
- **Layout**: Responsive layout with navigation drawer and app bar
- **API Service Layer**: Abstraction for backend communication using `fetch`

### Backend Components

- **API Server**: Go service built with Gin, providing endpoints for OCM resources:
  - `GET /api/clusters` - List all ManagedClusters
  - `GET /api/clusters/:name` - Get details for a specific ManagedCluster
  - `GET /api/clustersets` - List all ManagedClusterSets
  - `GET /api/clustersets/:name` - Get details for a specific ManagedClusterSet
  - `GET /api/clustersetbindings` - List all ManagedClusterSetBindings
  - `GET /api/clustersetbindings/:namespace` - List bindings in a namespace
  - `GET /api/clustersetbindings/:namespace/:name` - Get a specific binding
  - `GET /api/placements` - List all Placements
  - `GET /api/placements/:namespace` - List Placements in a namespace
  - `GET /api/placements/:namespace/:name` - Get a specific Placement
  - `GET /api/placements/:namespace/:name/decisions` - Get PlacementDecisions for a Placement
  - `GET /api/manifestworks/:namespace` - List ManifestWorks in a namespace (cluster)
  - `GET /api/manifestworks/:namespace/:name` - Get a specific ManifestWork
  - `GET /api/addons/:name` - List all Addons for a cluster
  - `GET /api/addons/:name/:addonName` - Get a specific Addon for a cluster
  - `GET /api/stream/clusters` - SSE endpoint for real-time ManagedCluster updates
- **Authentication**: Basic authorization header check. TokenReview validation is a TODO. Can be bypassed with `DASHBOARD_BYPASS_AUTH=true`.
- **Kubernetes Client**: Uses `client-go` to interact with the Kubernetes API for OCM resources (ManagedCluster, ManagedClusterSet, Placement, ManifestWork, Addon, etc.)
- **Mock Data Mode**: Supports running with mock data for development via `DASHBOARD_USE_MOCK=true`.

---

## Current Features

**Frontend:**

- Read-only view of clusters, placements, cluster sets, manifest works, and addons
- Table and detail views for all major OCM resources
- Real-time cluster status updates via SSE
- Authentication flow with token support (bearer token in localStorage)
- Responsive UI with Material UI components
- Overview dashboard with KPIs
- Error handling and loading states

**Backend:**

- API endpoints for all major OCM resources (Clusters, ClusterSets, ClusterSetBindings, Placements, ManifestWorks, Addons)
- Placement and PlacementDecision support
- ManifestWork and Addon support
- SSE endpoint for streaming cluster updates
- Kubernetes client integration using `client-go`
- Support for in-cluster and out-of-cluster kubeconfig
- CORS configured for broad access (e.g. `*`)
- Debug mode (`DASHBOARD_DEBUG=true`) and mock data mode (`DASHBOARD_USE_MOCK=true`)

---

## Setup & Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/pnpm
- Go 1.22+ (for backend development)
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster with OCM installed (for backend integration)

### Frontend Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173)

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
# Or use the development script:
./run-dev.sh
```

This script sets `DASHBOARD_USE_MOCK=true` and `DASHBOARD_DEBUG=true` by default.
Modify `.env.development` or set environment variables directly to change behavior (e.g., `KUBECONFIG` path, `PORT`).

### Connecting Frontend to Backend

The frontend (`src/api/utils.ts`) is configured to connect to the backend API, typically running on `http://localhost:8080`. Ensure the backend server is running when developing the frontend.
The `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env.development` (for frontend) should match the backend server address.

---

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

---

## RBAC Requirements (For Backend)

For the backend to function correctly, it will need RBAC permissions to:

1. List, get, and watch all OCM resources (ManagedCluster, ManagedClusterSet, ManagedClusterSetBinding, Placement, ManifestWork, Addon, etc.)
2. Perform token reviews for authentication

<details>
<summary>Example RBAC configuration</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: ocm-dashboard
  namespace: ocm-dashboard
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: ocm-dashboard-reader
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["cluster.open-cluster-management.io"]
    resources:
      [
        "managedclusters",
        "managedclustersets",
        "managedclustersetbindings",
        "placements",
        "placementdecisions",
        "manifestworks",
        "managedclusteraddons",
      ]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
  - apiGroups: ["authentication.k8s.io"]
    resources: ["tokenreviews"]
    verbs: ["create"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: ocm-dashboard-reader-binding
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: ocm-dashboard
    namespace: ocm-dashboard
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: ocm-dashboard-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

</details>

## Next Steps

1. Fully implement real-time updates using SSE with actual Kubernetes informers in the backend.
2. Implement robust TokenReview authentication in the backend.
3. Enhance error handling and user feedback in both frontend and backend.
4. Create a Helm chart for deployment.
5. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.
6. Improve UI/UX, potentially adding more visualizations or actions.
7. Add support for more OCM resource types and actions as needed.
8. Optimize frontend testing and mock implementation.
