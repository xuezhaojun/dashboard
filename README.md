## Project Overview

A dashboard for displaying and monitoring Open Cluster Management (OCM) clusters.

---

## Architecture

The OCM Dashboard follows a modern architecture pattern for Kubernetes dashboards:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript SPA with real-time updates
- **Backend**: Go API service that connects to the Kubernetes API (or uses mock data)

### Frontend Components

1. **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication (JWT) stored in localStorage
2. **ClusterList**: Table view with real-time status updates via Server-Sent Events
3. **ClusterDetail**: Detailed view of a single cluster with conditions and labels
4. **ClusterSetList**: Table view for ManagedClusterSets.
5. **ClusterSetDetail**: Detailed view for a single ManagedClusterSet.
6. **API Service**: Abstraction layer for backend communication using `fetch`.

### Backend Components

1. **API Server**: Go service built with Gin, providing the following endpoints:
   - `GET /api/clusters` - Lists all ManagedClusters.
   - `GET /api/clusters/:name` - Gets details for a specific ManagedCluster.
   - `GET /api/clustersets` - Lists all ManagedClusterSets.
   - `GET /api/clustersets/:name` - Gets details for a specific ManagedClusterSet.
   - `GET /api/stream/clusters` - SSE endpoint for real-time ManagedCluster updates (currently sends mock data or heartbeats).
2. **Authentication**: Basic authorization header check. TokenReview validation is a TODO. Can be bypassed with `DASHBOARD_BYPASS_AUTH=true`.
3. **Kubernetes Client**: Uses `client-go/dynamic` to interact with the Kubernetes API for OCM resources (ManagedCluster, ManagedClusterSet).
4. **Mock Data Mode**: Supports running with mock data for development via `DASHBOARD_USE_MOCK=true`.

---

## Current Features

**Frontend:**

- Read-only view of clusters and cluster sets.
- Table displaying cluster name, status, version.
- Detailed view for individual clusters.
- Table displaying cluster set name and cluster count.
- Detailed view for individual cluster sets.
- Authentication flow with token support (bearer token in localStorage).
- UI components for login, cluster list/detail, cluster set list/detail, overview, and layout.

**Backend:**

- API endpoints to list and get ManagedClusters and ManagedClusterSets.
- SSE endpoint for streaming cluster updates (mock or heartbeat).
- Kubernetes client integration using `client-go`.
- Support for in-cluster and out-of-cluster kubeconfig.
- CORS configured for broad access (e.g. `*`).
- Debug mode (`DASHBOARD_DEBUG=true`) and mock data mode (`DASHBOARD_USE_MOCK=true`).

---

## Setup & Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm/pnpm
- Go 1.22+ (for backend development)
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster with OCM installed (for backend integration)

### Frontend Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173)

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
# Or use the development script:
./run-dev.sh
```

This script sets `DASHBOARD_USE_MOCK=true` and `DASHBOARD_DEBUG=true` by default.
Modify `.env.development` or set environment variables directly to change behavior (e.g., `KUBECONFIG` path, `PORT`).

### Connecting Frontend to Backend

The frontend (`src/api/utils.ts`) is configured to connect to the backend API, typically running on `http://localhost:8080`. Ensure the backend server is running when developing the frontend.
The `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env.development` (for frontend) should match the backend server address.

---

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

---

## RBAC Requirements (For Backend)

For the backend to function correctly, it will need RBAC permissions to:

1. List, get, and watch ManagedCluster resources
2. Perform token reviews for authentication

<details>
<summary>Example RBAC configuration</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: ocm-dashboard
  namespace: ocm-dashboard
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: ocm-dashboard-reader
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["cluster.open-cluster-management.io"]
    resources: ["managedclusters, managedclustersets"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
  - apiGroups: ["authentication.k8s.io"]
    resources: ["tokenreviews"]
    verbs: ["create"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: ocm-dashboard-reader-binding
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: ocm-dashboard
    namespace: ocm-dashboard
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: ocm-dashboard-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

</details>

## Next Steps

1. Fully implement real-time updates using SSE with actual Kubernetes informers in the backend.
2. Implement robust TokenReview authentication in the backend.
3. Enhance error handling and user feedback in both frontend and backend.
4. Create a Helm chart for deployment.
5. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.
6. Improve UI/UX, potentially adding more visualizations or actions.
